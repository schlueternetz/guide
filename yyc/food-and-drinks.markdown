# Food and Drinks in Calgary
I love good food and drinks and here are my top spots in Calgary.
These are all local restaurants and bars that are not part of the nationwide chains you can find anywhere. And they are so much better than the chains!
If we were to go out together and you would ask me to pick a place, I would pick from this list.

## Best Restaurants
For every suggestion, I'm giving a quick overview:
- Locations are per city quadrant (eg. NW = North West) plus Downtown and Beltline.
- Price range about 10-15 CAD per $ symbol.
- Suggested meal for the restaurant.

### [Basil Ultimate Pho](https://goo.gl/maps/LxX6agvptufbCebc9)
#### NE | \$\$ | Lunch
Basil is the best Vietnamese Restaurant in Calgary. Spicy Pho, Sate Vermicelli, Spring rolls or Chicken Curry - everything is consistently good.
A bit limited hours, but a safe bet for lunch year-round.

### [Klein & Harris](https://goo.gl/maps/AwPfR489qhLggL6SA)
#### Downtown | \$\$\$\$ | Dinner
A great spot to celebrate any occasion. Great and diverse food and quite the cocktail menu - everyone will find something they like.

### [Caesar's Steak House](https://goo.gl/maps/BTkasWTrHNc6u15K6)
#### Downtown | \$\$\$\$ | Dinner
If you are looking for a good Alberta Steak - this is it. I tried many places over the years and nothing comes close to Caesar's. It's not cheap, but you get four courses and each one is simply incredible (incr-edible?).

### [Fusion Sushi](https://goo.gl/maps/AQfjvAbs5UrKLhAaA)
#### Multiple | \$\$\$ | Lunch/Dinner
There are a few locations across town. This is an all-you-can-eat Sushi and Japanese restaurant. While not quite as good as the a la carte Sushi places below, it's a great choice if you're really hungry.

### [Sushi Boat](https://goo.gl/maps/W4vXh2y3zHTKVhKV9)
#### NW | \$\$\$\$ | Lunch/Dinner
My go-to Sushi place. Consistently good food (that comes to you on a boat).

### [Hana Sushi](https://goo.gl/maps/nSyXFtUgfx4qPtrB8)
#### Beltline | \$\$\$\$ | Dinner
Another great Sushi restaurant, in the Beltline. Always fresh and a good variety.

### [Sudam Korean](https://goo.gl/maps/ZEu23KB58JfHptP56)
#### NW | \$\$\$ | Lunch/Dinner
This was such a surprise to discover. A tiny restaurant (make a reservation!) with maybe 10 tables. The food is phenomenal.

### [Blue Star Diner](https://goo.gl/maps/NJnZPiAx2igNUGb36)
#### NE | \$\$\$ | Breakfast/Brunch
Fantastic breakfast foods in a unique atmosphere.

### [The Bro'Kin Yolk](https://goo.gl/maps/ccv9BpVbx9BfEPUp8)
#### Multiple | \$\$\$ | Breakfast/Brunch
A great brunch spot to hang out with friends.

### [Zoo Brunch](https://www.calgaryzoo.com/events/safari-brunch)
#### Calgary Zoo | \$\$\$ | Brunch
If you have a Sunday to spend in Calgary, why not visit the zoo - and have brunch while you're there? You'll need to buy tickets in advance.

### [SS 106 Aperitivo Bar](https://goo.gl/maps/kQzqxYctkS7UnYzP6)
#### NE | \$\$\$\$ | Dinner
This Italian restaurant is so good. You must try the gorgonzola mushroom Gnocci. You must.

### [Hayden Block](https://g.page/haydenblock?share)
#### Multiple | \$\$\$ | Dinner
There are a few locations in town with slightly different names (eg. South Block), but they are essentially the same: The best slow cooked meat in town plus a Whiskey-heavy drink list make for a great evening for all meat lovers.

### [Pampa Brazilian BBQ](https://g.page/PampaCalgary?share)
#### Beltline | \$\$\$\$ | Dinner
Still looking for meat? This place has all-you-can-eat meat sliced right at your table. Oh, and all the fixings on a buffet on the side.

### [Calgary Tower](https://goo.gl/maps/bZYm54e36pHw2gin7)
#### Downtown | \$\$\$ | Dinner
If you're in Calgary for the first time, this might be a nice spot for a sunset dinner. The food is good (not outstanding) but what makes this place is the rotating floor - you get to see a 360 of Calgary while you eat.

### [Pfanntastic Pannenkoek Haus](https://goo.gl/maps/7CTfQRj7DAGVxx19A)
#### NW | \$\$ | Brunch
A Dutch restaurant serving sweet and savoury pancakes. Try the Bacon & Shredded potato one.
