## You can skip
Here are some places that are somewhat famous in Calgary, but I would not recommend them.
- Modern Steak: Go to Caesar's instead.
- Bottlescrew Bills: Go to National or Craft up 10 Ave instead.
- Kilkenny's Brentwood: Any other neighbourhood pub will be better.
- Big T's BBQ: Go to Hayden / South Block instead.
- Rose & Crown: Go to the Ship & Anchor instead.
- All the big chains: They're everywhere, and just mediocre.     
- Last Best Brewery
