## Stampede
Yee-Haw! Each July, the famous Calgary Stampede transforms Calgary into Cowboy-land. Well, around the Stampede Grounds anyways.
If you've never been, it's worth going for a day to check it out (or more if you're into it). Besides walking around the grounds where you find lots of food vendors, rides and games, here are a few tips to make your Stampede Day even better:
- C-Trains are free on Stampede Days, but VERY busy.
- Different companies and neighborhoods host free Stampede Breakfasts. You can get free pancake breakfast every day [if you know where to go.](https://stampedebreakfast.ca/) 
- The parade on the first Friday of Stampede is pretty cool. It's free and runs throughout downtown. It takes a few hours, so bring your lawn chair (and show up early if you want front row seats).
- The Rodeo Show at the Grandstand in the afternoon is interesting, any seat will work.
- Chuckwagon / Evening Show: The chuckwagon races are not as interesting as the Rodeo show. But the evening show has some interesting performances and big fireworks. Stay to the end!
- Check the lineup at the Coca Cola Stage. It's free with admission and they have some cool music playing!
- There are other concerts and shows of world-class artists happening in surrounding venues during this time. 


## You can skip
When you google "Things to do in Calgary", these likely come up. I wouldn't recommend going.
- Crossiron Mills mall: The big "outlet" mall just outside of Calgary. But very disappointing compared to other outlet malls. It's mostly a regular mall with slightly sub-regular prices. Don't expect many big deals.
- Music hall: You must be seriously into music to enjoy this. Lots of posters, artist dresses/suits and instruments to look at, but it's mostly a reading exercise.
- Walk around Inglewood: Often praised as an especially beautiful neighborhood with a unique vibe. It became popular enough to price out almost all the stores that made it unique. Besides the record store and the spice store, there is not much left worth exploring.
- Lilac Festival: The first festival of the year. It's mostly food trucks and pop-up tent stores. Not much else happening, and the streets get so crowded it gets hard to move at all.
