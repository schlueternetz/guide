# Lake Louise Area

## Places to Eat
- Lake Louise: Laggan's Bakery. Try their health cookie as a great snack on a hike.
- Lake Louise: Trailhead Cafe. It's a great spot to pick up a lunch.

## Places to Stay
- Lake Louise Campground: It's big, but quite nice. The separate tent loop keeps RVs and their noisy generators away - fantastic!!

## Places to See
- Lake Louise: It has gotten so busy with tourists that it is less enjoyable now. You may have to take a shuttle bus to get there. The tea house hikes are nice, but expect line-ups and bring cash. The Plain-of-Six-Glaciers tea house has a nicer hiking trail, the Lake Agnes teahouse is the nicer destination.
- Lake Louise Gondola: It operates in the summer too and gets you up the mountains and some nice views without having to sweat for it! They often report bear sightings.
- Moraine Lake: Also super busy. If against all odds you do get in, the walk up the little rock pile is nice and gives you the perfect viewpoint of the lake that you see in all the iconic photos.

- Takakaw Falls
