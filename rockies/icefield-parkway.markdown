# Icefield Parkway - Lake Louise to Jasper

## Places to Eat
- Jasper: Syrah. On the expensive side, but very good food and service.
- Saskatchewan Crossing: The resort has decent food options.

## Places to Stay
- Wilderness Hostels. Check out the HI (Hostelling International) wilderness hostels. No running water, shared dorm rooms, lots of cool people to meet. The best ones: Mosquito Creek, Maligne Canyon, Athabasca Falls and Rampart Creek.

## Places to See
- Bow Lake: Park at the lodge for the best views and access to some trails
- Peyto Lake: Stop for a walk to the viewpoint that oversees the lake. No access to the lake itself from here, but worth a stop.
- Athabasca Falls: Nice pathway to see the falls.
- Mistaya Canyon: Another quick walk to a nice canyon.
- Columbia Icefields: You can walk up to the edge (it is always **very** windy and cold here, layer up) but don't cross the barriers. Friends say the Ice Explorer ride is nice (you go onto the glacier in a bus with massive snow tires)
- Abraham Lake is cool in winter (try from January on, must be frozen solid) because methane bubbles form in the ice.

## Places to Skip
For various reasons I would not recommend the following:

- Columbia Icefields Center: A tourist trap otherwise. Mediocre food, massively overpriced, bad service IMHO. Skip the walk on the glass bridge too.
- Side trip from Jasper to Mount Robson Provincial Park: A stunning area, but unless you have time and energy for long hikes (and/or backcountry permits), there isn't much to see that you can just drive or walk up to.
