# Icefield Parkway - Lake Louise to Jasper

## Places to Eat
- Lake Louise: Laggan's Bakery. Try their health cookie as a great snack on a hike.
- Lake Louise: Trailhead Cafe. It's a great spot to pick up a lunch.
- Jasper: Syrah. On the expensive side, but very good food and service.
- Saskatchewan Crossing: The resort has decent food options.

## Places to Stay
- Wilderness Hostels. Check out the HI (Hostelling International) wilderness hostels. No running water, shared dorm rooms, lots of cool people to meet. The best ones: Mosquito Creek, Maligne Canyon, Athabasca Falls and Rampart Creek.

## Places to See
- Lake Louise: It has gotten so busy with tourists that it is less enjoyable now. You may have to take a shuttle bus to get there. The tea house hikes are nice, but expect line-ups and bring cash. The Plain-of-Six-Glaciers tea house has a nicer hiking trail, the Lake Agnes teahouse is the nicer destination.
- Lake Louise Gondola: It operates in the summer too and gets you up the mountains and some nice views without having to sweat for it! They often report bear sightings.
- Moraine Lake: Also super busy. If against all odds you do get in, the walk up the little rock pile is nice and gives you the perfect viewpoint of the lake that you see in all the iconic photos.
- Bow Lake: Park at the lodge for the best views and access to some trails
- Peyto Lake: Stop for a walk to the viewpoint that oversees the lake. No access to the lake itself from here, but worth a stop.
- Athabasca Falls: Nice pathway to see the falls.
- Mistaya Canyon: Another quick walk to a nice canyon.
- Columbia Icefields: You can walk up to the edge (it is always **very** windy and cold here, layer up) but don't cross the barriers. Friends say the Ice Explorer ride is nice (you go onto the glacier in a bus with massive snow tires)
- Abraham Lake is cool in winter (try from January on, must be frozen solid) because methane bubbles form in the ice.

## Places to Skip
For various reasons I would not recommend the following:

- Columbia Icefields Center: A tourist trap otherwise. Mediocre food, massively overpriced, bad service IMHO. Skip the walk on the glass bridge too.
- Side trip to Mount Robson Provincial Park: A stunning area, but unless you have time and energy for long hikes (and/or backcountry permits), there isn't much to see that you can just drive up to.
